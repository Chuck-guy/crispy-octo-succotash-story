After a while, Vaugn found himself less and less enamored with the histerics of Waterdeep. Another missing person reported or another trade ship lost at sea longer worried or excited Vaugn like they might have when he first moved to the coast 5 years ago. Indeed, today he found himself looking out at the harbor without much thought as pirates sailed away with stolen goods from the harbor.

- I wonder what the pirates are doing this for and if the missing person can be linked to them.

-Sighing, Vaugn turned away and began to walk back into town. Suddenly, a mysterious figure caught his eye. A hooded man in green robes, holding a sunflower. Normally, a strange man holding a flower wouldn't catch Vaugn by surprise. However, the flower the stranger was holding was a sunflower. Sunflowers were only found in an island isolated for many years, with nobody ever seeing one in person. Intrigued, Vaugn followed him.
